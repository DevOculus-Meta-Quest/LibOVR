## Introduction

LibOVR aims to make Oculus VR development smoother and more accessible. It encapsulates various functionalities such as initialization, session management, tracking, input handling, and rendering, providing a comprehensive interface for VR application development.

## Features

- **Initialization and Session Management**: Easily initialize the OVR client and manage VR sessions.
- **Tracking**: Obtain detailed tracking information for implementing immersive experiences.
- **Input Handling**: Handle inputs from various controllers efficiently.
- **Rendering**: Manage texture swap chains for rendering VR content.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the examples, ensure that you have properly set up your development environment and have a basic understanding of Oculus VR development.

## Examples

### 1. **Initializing the OVR Client and Creating a Session**

```csharp
OvrClient ovrClient;
if (OvrClient.TryInitialize(out ovrClient))
{
    OvrSession ovrSession;
    if (ovrClient.TryCreateSession(out ovrSession))
    {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

### 2. **Getting Tracking State**

```csharp
double absTime = ...; // specify the absolute time
OvrTrackingState trackingState = ovrSession.GetTrackingState(absTime, OvrBool.False);

// Accessing head pose
OvrPosef headPose = trackingState.HeadPose;
```

### 3. **Handling Input**

```csharp
OvrInputState inputState;
if (ovrSession.GetInputState(OvrControllerType.Touch, out inputState))
{
    // Check if a button is pressed
    if ((inputState.Buttons & OvrButton.A) != 0)
    {
        // Button A is pressed
    }
}
```

### 4. **Managing Texture Swap Chains**

```csharp
OvrTextureSwapChainDesc desc = new OvrTextureSwapChainDesc
{
    Type = OvrTextureType._2D,
    Format = OvrTextureFormat.R8G8B8A8_UNORM_SRGB,
    ArraySize = 1,
    Width = 1024,
    Height = 1024,
    MipLevels = 1,
    SampleCount = 1,
    StaticImage = OvrBool.False,
};

OvrTextureSwapChain textureSwapChain;
ovrSession.CreateTextureSwapChainDX(dxDevice, desc, out textureSwapChain);
```

## Conclusion

LibOVR is a powerful wrapper that simplifies Oculus VR development, allowing you to focus on creating immersive and engaging VR experiences. Explore the various functionalities, and donâ€™t hesitate to dive into the code to understand the intricacies and unleash the full potential of this library.
